# ImageGen

This is an API based client for creating images using DALL-E.

There's not a lot to it.

It places the results in a timestamped file in the `outputs/` directory.  For each request, it saves
both the prompt you supplied and the results.

You can modify the size and quality of the images generated by changing the source code.
